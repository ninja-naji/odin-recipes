    <h2>What is Dominican Potato Salad (Ensalada Rusa)</h2>
    <p>
      This recipe is very popular in Dominican culture, where it’s also known as
      ensalada mixta (mixed salad). You’ll find us making this ensalada mostly
      for Christmas dinner but I like to have it for any occasion really. his
      salad is made in some way across many Western countries, where it is also
      well known as a Russian Salad. This salad did originate from Russia, and
      it’s just another one of the many dishes in Dominican food that have
      influences from other cultures.

        add the eggs to the pot to boil the eggs with the potatoes and carrots
